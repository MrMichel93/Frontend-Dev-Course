## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Quick Self-Assessment

Ask yourself:
- Can I create a basic HTML page with a form?
- Do I understand CSS selectors and the box model?
- Am I comfortable with JavaScript variables, functions, and arrays?
- Have I worked with asynchronous JavaScript (callbacks or promises)?

**Yes to all?** Great! Skim through the refreshers and jump to setup.

**Some uncertainties?** Review the refresher materials carefully.

**Mostly no?** Consider taking a beginner HTML/CSS/JavaScript course first. We recommend:
- [MDN Web Docs - Learn Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
- [freeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)

### Step 2: Review Materials

1. Start with [html-css-refresher.md](./html-css-refresher.md)
2. Continue with [javascript-essentials.md](./javascript-essentials.md)
3. Take the [quiz.md](./quiz.md) to check your understanding

### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment

Follow the instructions in [setup.md](./setup.md) to:
- Install Node.js and npm
- Install VS Code and extensions
- Verify your installation
- Learn essential terminal commands

### Step 4: Verify Your Setup

Once you've completed setup, run this quick check:

```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 18 or higher)
node --version

# Check npm version
npm --version

# Create a test project
mkdir test-setup
cd test-setup
npm init -y
npm install react react-dom

# If no errors, you're ready!
cd ..
rm -rf test-setup
```

## 🎓 Knowledge Check
