# Tailwind CSS Exercises 💪

## Overview

This directory contains hands-on exercises for practicing Tailwind CSS. Each exercise builds a real-world component using Tailwind's utility classes.

## How to Use

1. Open each exercise file in your code editor
2. Read the requirements carefully
3. Use Tailwind CSS utility classes to build the component
4. Test your components by integrating them into a React app
5. Reference the [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) as needed

## Tips

- Use consistent spacing with Tailwind's spacing scale
- Test on different screen sizes
- Experiment with different utilities
- Focus on semantic HTML structure first, then add styling

2. Create a complete page layout
