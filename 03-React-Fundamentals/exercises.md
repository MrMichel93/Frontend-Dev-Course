## Tips for Exercises

1. **Start Simple** - Build basic structure first
2. **Add State** - Identify what data changes
3. **Handle Events** - Add interactivity
4. **Style Last** - Focus on functionality first
5. **Test** - Try different scenarios
6. **Refactor** - Extract reusable components

## Solution Approach

For each exercise:
1. Plan component structure
2. Identify props needed
3. Determine state requirements
4. Implement UI first
5. Add event handlers
6. Test functionality
7. Add styling
8. Refactor if needed

## Common Patterns to Practice

- ✅ Props destructuring
- ✅ State updates (immutable)
- ✅ Event handling
- ✅ List rendering with keys
- ✅ Conditional rendering (&&, ternary)
- ✅ Component composition
- ✅ Form handling
- ✅ Children prop usage

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises:
1. Build your own project ideas
2. Explore React hooks in-depth
3. Learn state management libraries
