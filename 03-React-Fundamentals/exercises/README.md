# React Fundamentals Exercises 💪

## Overview

This directory contains hands-on React exercises covering all fundamental concepts. Each exercise builds a real component or application feature using React.

## Exercise Files

Each exercise is in a separate JSX file. Open each file and follow the instructions in the comments to build the component.

1. **exercise-1-profile-card.jsx** - Profile Card Component (Props & JSX)
2. **exercise-2-todo-list.jsx** - Todo List Application (State & Events)
3. **exercise-3-counter.jsx** - Counter with Multiple Operations (useState)
4. **exercise-4-form-validation.jsx** - Form with Validation (Controlled Components)
5. **exercise-5-product-catalog.jsx** - Product Catalog (Lists & Filtering)
6. **exercise-6-modal-dialog.jsx** - Modal Dialog Component (Composition & Children)
7. **exercise-7-user-dashboard.jsx** - User Dashboard (Component Composition)
8. **exercise-8-theme-switcher.jsx** - Theme Switcher (State & Props)
9. **bonus-social-media-feed.jsx** - Social Media Feed (Complex State)

## How to Use

1. Open each exercise file in your code editor
2. Read the requirements and instructions carefully
3. Implement the component following React best practices
4. Test your component by integrating it into a React app
5. Experiment and add your own features!

## Tips for Exercises

1. **Start Simple** - Build basic structure first
2. **Add State** - Identify what data changes
3. **Handle Events** - Add interactivity
4. **Style Last** - Focus on functionality first
5. **Test** - Try different scenarios
6. **Refactor** - Extract reusable components

## Common Patterns to Practice

- ✅ Props destructuring
- ✅ State updates (immutable)
- ✅ Event handling
- ✅ List rendering with keys
- ✅ Conditional rendering (&&, ternary)
- ✅ Component composition
- ✅ Form handling
- ✅ Children prop usage

## Solution Approach

For each exercise:
1. Plan component structure
2. Identify props needed
3. Determine state requirements
4. Implement UI first
5. Add event handlers
6. Test functionality
7. Add styling
8. Refactor if needed

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises:
1. Build your own project ideas
2. Explore React hooks in-depth
3. Learn state management libraries (Redux, Zustand)
4. Practice with real APIs
5. Study React best practices and patterns

Keep coding and building! 🚀
